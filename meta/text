Hi-yah! [VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]! Do you want to try Restricted Sparring?
Yes
Tell me how it works
No thanks
No, I’ll quit
Select the type you want to use for sparring.
I won’t force you to do anything you don’t want to do. Some other time, then.
Restricted Sparring is a training course that restricts the type of Pokémon you can use. Select a type first, and then battle using up to three Pokémon of that type. No duplicate Pokémon or items are allowed. If you can win five times in a row, you’ll complete the training. However, if you lose even once, the sparring will end there! You can restore your Pokémon between battles, but only twice in total, so use the opportunities very wisely. That’s all! Do you want to try Restricted Sparring?
Oh, you changed your mind? Some other time, then.
Let the battles begin! Battle No. 1! Ready...
Next. Battle No. [VAR 0203(0001,0000)]! Ready...
