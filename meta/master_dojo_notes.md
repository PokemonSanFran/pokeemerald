# BATTLES
[x] Only 2 heals per challenge
[x] If the player's Pokémon has an item that can be consumed during battle, such as a Berry, and that item is removed (no matter if that's caused by being consumed normally, consumed by another Pokémon using Bug Bite, or by a move such as Knock Off), that item will not be restored after the battle unless the player chooses to heal their team, or the challenge ends.
[x] If a Pokémon holds an item that can't normally be consumed, but that item is moved or removed during battle with Thief, Knock Off, Trick, Switcheroo, Fling, Bestow, Corrosive Gas, Pickpocket, or Magician, it will be restored after the battle.
[x] When player uses heal, all items are restored
[] Get 3 BP for each win, every multiple of 5 gets 20, first time getting 5 [] wins in that type gets 30 BP
[] Consumable held items do not come back except for a heal
[] Difficulty should start on final level from the jump
[] Restrict teams based on type chosen
[] Add new area to the saveblock for teams and record

# GRAPHIC
[] Create OW special that opens this screen
[] Create background tilemap
[] Scrollbar works
[] Record and Pokemon box only appears once player has participated
[] Record box shows the current highest record
[] Pokemon box shows three pokemon that participated in highest record
[] Row is highlighted black and text changes color when highlighted
[] Crown icon shows when user has completed that streak

# PRINCIPLES
[] Feature branch should be able to be pulled and used by users right now
[] Should feel like a Battle Facility from Emerald, with different rules, _NOT_ a SwSh feature dropped into Emerald
[] Add config for people to store mons on saveblock
