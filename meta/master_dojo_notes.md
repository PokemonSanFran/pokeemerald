# BATTLES
[x] Only 2 heals per challenge
[x] If the player's Pokémon has an item that can be consumed during battle, such as a Berry, and that item is removed (no matter if that's caused by being consumed normally, consumed by another Pokémon using Bug Bite, or by a move such as Knock Off), that item will not be restored after the battle unless the player chooses to heal their team, or the challenge ends.
[x] If a Pokémon holds an item that can't normally be consumed, but that item is moved or removed during battle with Thief, Knock Off, Trick, Switcheroo, Fling, Bestow, Corrosive Gas, Pickpocket, or Magician, it will be restored after the battle.
[x] When player uses heal, all items are restored
[x] Get 3 BP for each win, every multiple of 5 gets 20, first time getting 5 [] wins in that type gets 30 BP
[x] Consumable held items do not come back except for a heal
[x] Restrict teams based on type chosen
[x] Add new area to the saveblock for teams and record
[x] Handle giving out symbols

[x] Difficulty should start on final level from the jump
[x] figure out how SwSh builds opponents and then mimic
[] Show mons on saveblock
[] window needs to be 120 wide because each pokemon is 40 wide max
[] Crown icon shows when user has completed that streak, use the same function that is printing the text to the win streak window to print text in the type name window
[] If that works, you either need to make this multichoice wider OR make new strings that have spacers at the end
[] Code cleanup
